# Advent of Code 2022

I did most of this year in Kotlin.
A couple of the early days I jumped ship to Python so I could implement fast,
but by the end I was quite comfortable with Kotlin!

Most, if not all, of my solutions here had 0 effort put into making them readable or maintainable.
I have also made no effort to preserve my solutions to Part 1s, so most of these only output my part 2 answer.

Pretty happy with most of my final placements for this year:
